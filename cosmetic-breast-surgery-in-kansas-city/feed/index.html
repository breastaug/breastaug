		<description><![CDATA[Ally it is important to not just lie in bed for weeks after. A few days after you surgery you should be up and moving around gently. Small walks help your circulation which in turn aids healing. Do non strenuous activities. Anything that doesnt involve you lifting your arms or lifting anything heavy. Get your friends to visit. Catch up on favourite movies. Ask a friend to pick you up to do some shopping. Go thru your horse rugs to see what needs repair ....that sort of thing]]></description>
